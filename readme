Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

Definitely helpful in diving deeper into a codebase and learning to 
build on existing code. At some point, the grind of doing this 
assignment became a spiteful endeavor, at which point it was fun!

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

 ft.c: line 157: low priority: 
   A loop should consist of fewer than 35 lines;
   this loop consists of 45 lines; consider refactoring

   ft.c: line 894: low priority: 
   A file should contain no more than 15 functions;
   this file contains 16 functions

   ft.c: line 491: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?

   ft.c: line 741: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?

   ft.c: line 893: low priority: 
   A source code file should contain fewer than 500 lines;
   this file contains 894 lines

   defense:
	•	ft.c: line 96: low priority:
the loop’s length is necessary for clarity and cannot be shortened. 
when tried, immediatly had errors.
	•	ft.c: line 847: low priority:
having 16 functions is acceptable to maintain cohesive functionality.
this allowed me to split up key parts into helper functions to help with gdb.
	•	ft.c: line 432: medium priority:
asserting ‘pvContents’ isn’t needed as NULL contents are valid.
	•	ft.c: line 701: medium priority:
‘pvNewContents’ can be NULL to clear contents, so no assert is required.
	•	ft.c: line 846: low priority:
the file length is justified by the complexity of the code and is mostly
due to comments.

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1            BDT_insert   
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2             BDT_freeSubtree
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3            BDT_addChild
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4             BDT_strlenAccumulate
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5            BDT_findNode
===============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?
